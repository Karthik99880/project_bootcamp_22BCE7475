This code generates a dashboard to visualize the distribution of review ratings on a product. The data used in this code is extracted from an Amazon dataset, which includes details like product name, price, discount, rating, and the number of times each rating was given.

The code includes the following steps:

1) Importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
2) Loading the dataset using pandas.
3) Cleaning the rating column and dropping rows with missing values.
4) Filtering the relevant columns from the dataset.
5) Splitting the data into four star ratings and above, three star ratings and above, and two star ratings and above.
6) Calculating the sizes of each star rating category.
7) Visualizing the sizes of each star rating category using a bar plot and a pie chart.

'The resulting bar plot displays the number of reviews for each star rating category. The pie chart provides a visual representation of the percentage distribution of review ratings.
